# Agent Team Setup

This command installs the cgjedrem agent-team personas and supporting material that
shipped with the `agent-team` preset into the current project.

The preset pack is on disk at `.specify/presets/agent-team/` relative to the
current project root. All source files referenced below live inside that
directory (unless noted otherwise).

## What to install

1. **Personas** — copy every file in `.specify/presets/agent-team/agents/` into
   `.github/agents/`:
   - coordinator.agent.md
   - backend-dev.agent.md
   - frontend-dev.agent.md
   - qa-reviewer.agent.md
   - code-explorer.agent.md
   - editor.agent.md
   - tasker.agent.md

2. **Charter fragment seeds** — copy `.specify/presets/agent-team/charter/` into
   `.charter/` at the project root (creating `.charter/` if absent). This seeds a
   charter registry with a starter `manifest.yml` and six fragments:
   `platform/windows-powershell` (mandatory) plus `backend/node-backend`,
   `client/react-client`, `quality/playwright-e2e`, `toolchain/npm-strict`,
   `toolchain/pnpm-strict` (recommended — per-project choices).

   **Per-project toolchain choice (v1.1.0)**: the toolchain fragment is chosen
   per project, not forced. When the project later runs
   `/speckit.charter.config`, select exactly ONE of:

   - `toolchain/npm-strict` — npm end-to-end repos (`npm ci`, `npm run <script>`,
     one-off tools via `npx --yes <tool>@<exact-version>`)
   - `toolchain/pnpm-strict` — pnpm repos (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`,
     `pnpm <script>` / `pnpm dlx`)

   Pick the manager the repo already uses (npm: Frivollig, Ungfritid,
   path-of-practice; pnpm: ticker, Pocket-Smith client). Composing both is a
   conflict; composing neither leaves package-manager rules unspecified.

   If `.charter/` already holds a v1.0.x seed (its manifest lists
   `toolchain/pnpm-strict` under `mandatory_fragments`), offer to update
   `.charter/manifest.yml` to the per-project-choice manifest and to add the
   new fragment files (`toolchain/npm-strict`, `quality/playwright-e2e`) —
   this is the expected v1.1.0 upgrade path. Keep any locally adapted fragment
   content the user wants to preserve (e.g. Frivillig's local npm adaptation
   is superseded by the official `toolchain/npm-strict` fragment).

3. **Red-team lens catalog scaffold (v1.1.0)** — the `red-team` extension
   requires `.specify/extensions/red-team/red-team-lenses.yml` as its config,
   but nothing scaffolds it at install time; without it the mandatory
   `before_plan` gate fails fast with "no lens catalog". If
   `.specify/extensions/red-team/red-team-lenses.yml` does NOT exist and the
   red-team extension is installed (its `config-template.yml` is present),
   copy `.specify/extensions/red-team/config-template.yml` to
   `.specify/extensions/red-team/red-team-lenses.yml`. Then verify the lens
   catalog covers ALL SIX trigger categories: the union of every lens's
   `trigger_match` must include `money_path`, `regulatory_path`, `ai_llm`,
   `immutability_audit`, `multi_party`, and `contracts` (the shipped 4-lens
   template covers all six). If `red-team-lenses.yml` already exists, leave it
   untouched — it may be locally calibrated. If the red-team extension is not
   installed, skip this step and say so.

4. **QA review gate overlay (auto-registered in v1.1.0)** — check whether the
   overlay is already registered:

   ```powershell
   specify workflow overlay list speckit
   ```

   If `qa-review-gate` is NOT listed, register the shipped overlay:

   ```powershell
   specify workflow overlay add .specify/presets/agent-team/overlays/qa-review-gate.yml
   ```

   then re-run `specify workflow overlay list speckit` and confirm
   `qa-review-gate` appears with `priority=10`, enabled. If it is already
   registered, skip and report it as already present.

## Rules

- **Never overwrite an existing file without asking.** If a persona, fragment,
  or config file already exists at the destination, report it as a conflict,
  show the diff on request, and only replace it after explicit user
  confirmation. The red-team scaffold never touches an existing
  `red-team-lenses.yml`; the overlay step never re-adds a registered overlay.
- Create destination directories as needed (`.github/agents/`, `.charter/`).
- Copy files byte-for-byte; do not reformat, re-wrap, or "improve" persona or
  fragment content.
- After copying, list exactly which files were created, skipped (already
  present), and — only with approval — overwritten.

## Verify

When done, verify and report:
- `.github/agents/` contains all 7 `*.agent.md` files.
- `.charter/manifest.yml` exists, lists `platform/windows-powershell` as the
  only mandatory fragment, and lists `backend/node-backend`,
  `client/react-client`, `quality/playwright-e2e`, `toolchain/npm-strict`, and
  `toolchain/pnpm-strict` as recommended (per-project choice).
- `.specify/extensions/red-team/red-team-lenses.yml` exists (when the red-team
  extension is installed) and its lenses' combined `trigger_match` covers all
  six trigger categories.
- `specify workflow overlay list speckit` shows `qa-review-gate` with
  `priority=10`, enabled.
